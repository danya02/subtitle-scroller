1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,826
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
not a footprint to be seen.

2
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:28,398
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen.

3
00:00:28,498 --> 00:00:36,594
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.

4
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:42,864
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried.

5
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:46,519
Don't let them in, don't let them see.

6
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:49,827
Be the good girl you always have to be.

7
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:56,173
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know.

8
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:59,572
Well, now they know!

9
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:03,076
Let it go, let it go!

10
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:06,096
Can't hold it back any more.

11
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:10,066
Let it go, let it go!

12
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,697
Turn away and slam the door.

13
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:20,266
I don't care what they're going to say.

14
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:24,401
Let the storm rage on.

15
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,759
The cold never bothered me anyway.

16
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:34,495
It's funny how some distance,

17
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:38,344
makes everything seem small.

18
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:46,054
And the fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all

19
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:49,792
It's time to see what I can do,

20
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:53,477
to test the limits and break through.

21
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:57,494
No right, no wrong, no rules for me.

22
00:01:57,594 --> 00:02:00,452
I'm free!

23
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:04,546
Let it go, let it go.

24
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:08,077
I am one with the wind and sky.

25
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:11,442
Let it go, let it go.

26
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:15,386
You'll never see me cry.

27
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:22,241
Here I'll stand, and here I'll stay.

28
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:26,106
Let the storm rage on.

29
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:40,335
My power flurries through the air into the ground.

30
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:47,561
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

31
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:54,266
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

32
00:02:54,366 --> 00:03:02,175
I'm never going back; the past is in the past!

33
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:05,994
Let it go, let it go.

34
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:09,552
And I'll rise like the break of dawn.

35
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:13,022
Let it go, let it go

36
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:16,889
That perfect girl is gone

37
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:25,315
Here I stand, in the light of day.

38
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:31,145
Let the storm rage on!

39
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,214
The cold never bothered me anyway...
