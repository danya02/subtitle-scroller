# subtitle-scroller
This program displays subtitles in a text terminal. It is mostly intended for displaying karaoke lyrics, hence the `FILL-IN` message during pauses and hence the fact that the default .srt file contains lyrics from the [song "Let It Go"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_It_Go_(Disney_song)).

Note to Windows users: This program requires a terminal emulator supporting escape sequences. Your CMD.EXE *will not do!* As of now, I don't have any other method of controlling the terminal cursor except escape sequences, nor the system to test against, nor am I able to see the point in trying to support a system whose default terminal is so [losing](http://www.catb.org/esr/jargon/html/L/losing.html) (or is it more in the nature of [cretinous](http://www.catb.org/esr/jargon/html/C/cretinous.html)? I's quite [bogus](http://www.catb.org/esr/jargon/html/B/bogus.html) either way.)
